Huffman Coding

This Java project is an implementation of Huffman coding, a lossless data compression algorithm.
It can encode and decode text and jpg files, resulting in smaller file sizes while preserving the original content.

Computes character frequency from input text files. Generates Huffman codes from character frequencies.
Encodes input text files using Huffman codes. Decodes encoded files back to their original content.
Stores and reads character frequency data from separate files.
